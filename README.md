# Hi there! 👋

🎓 **About Me:** I'm a gap year student at [ISAE Supaero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/), with an interest in earth observation for climatology, oceanology, and biodiversity. 
During my gap year, I've had the opportunity to study supervised learning at the National University of Singapore, refining my skills in this area.

🌍 **Earth Observation Enthusiast:** I'm fascinated by the applications of earth observation techniques in understanding our planet's climate, oceans, and ecosystems.
From satellite imagery to remote sensing, I'm eager to explore these fields further and contribute to meaningful projects.

💻 **Data Science Aficionado:** I love working with data! Whether it's analyzing trends, building predictive models, or crafting compelling data visualizations, I'm always up for a challenge. 
Visualizing data allows me to communicate insights effectively and uncover patterns that drive informed decisions.

🔭 **Looking Ahead:** As I continue my gap year journey, I'm excited to further develop my skills in earth observation and data science. I'm open to collaborations, learning opportunities, and projects that align with my interests and values. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:Hugo.ANDRE@student.isae-supaero.fr)!

Ready to make a positive impact! 🌟
